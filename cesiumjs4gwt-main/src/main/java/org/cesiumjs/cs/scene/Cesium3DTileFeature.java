/**
 * A feature of a {@link Cesium3DTileset}.
 * Provides access to a feature's properties stored in the tile's batch table, as well as the ability to show/hide a
 * feature and change its highlight color via {@link Cesium3DTileset#show} and {@link Cesium3DTileFeature#color}, respectively.
 *
 * Modifications to a Cesium3DTileFeature object have the lifetime of the tile's content. If the tile's c
 * ontent is unloaded, e.g., due to it going out of view and needing to free space in the cache for visible tiles,
 * listen to the {@link Cesium3DTileset#tileUnload} event to save any modifications. Also listen to the {@link Cesium3DTileset#tileVisible}
 * event to reapply any modifications.
 *
 * Do not construct this directly. Access it through {@link Cesium3DTileContent#getFeature} or picking using Scene#pick and {@link Scene#pickPosition}.
