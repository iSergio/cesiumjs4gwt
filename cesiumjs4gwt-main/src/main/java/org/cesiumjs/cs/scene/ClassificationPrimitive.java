/**
 * A classification primitive represents a volume enclosing geometry in the Scene to be highlighted.
 * The geometry must be from a single GeometryInstance. Batching multiple geometries is not yet supported.
 * A primitive combines the geometry instance with an Appearance that describes the full shading, including Material
 * and RenderState. Roughly, the geometry instance defines the structure and placement, and the appearance defines
 * the visual characteristics. Decoupling geometry and appearance allows us to mix and match most of them and add a
 * new geometry or appearance independently of each other. Only the PerInstanceColorAppearance is supported at this time.
 *
 * For correct rendering, this feature requires the EXT_frag_depth WebGL extension. For hardware that do not
 * support this extension, there will be rendering artifacts for some viewing angles.
 *
 * Valid geometries are BoxGeometry, CylinderGeometry, EllipsoidGeometry, PolylineVolumeGeometry, and SphereGeometry.
 *
 * Geometries that follow the surface of the ellipsoid, such as CircleGeometry, CorridorGeometry, EllipseGeometry,
 * PolygonGeometry, and RectangleGeometry, are also valid if they are extruded volumes; otherwise, they will not be rendered.
