/**
 * A 3D model based on glTF, the runtime asset format for WebGL, OpenGL ES, and OpenGL.
 * Cesium includes support for geometry and materials, glTF animations, and glTF skinning. In addition, individual glTF
 * nodes are pickable with {@link Scene#pick} and animatable with {@link Model#getNode}. glTF cameras and lights are not currently supported.
 *
 * An external glTF asset is created with Model.fromGltf. glTF JSON can also be created at runtime and passed to
 * this constructor function. In either case, the {@link Model#readyPromise} is resolved when the model is ready to render,
 * i.e., when the external binary, image, and shader files are downloaded and the WebGL resources are created.
 *
 * For high-precision rendering, Cesium supports the CESIUM_RTC extension, which introduces the CESIUM_RTC_MODELVIEW
 * parameter semantic that says the node is in WGS84 coordinates translated relative to a local origin.
