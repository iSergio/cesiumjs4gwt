     * The Animation widget provides buttons for play, pause, and reverse, along with the current time and date,
     * surrounded by a "shuttle ring" for controlling the speed of animation.
     *
     * The "shuttle ring" concept is borrowed from video editing, where typically a "jog wheel" can be rotated to
     * move past individual animation frames very slowly, and a surrounding shuttle ring can be twisted to control
     * direction and speed of fast playback. Cesium typically treats time as continuous (not broken into pre-defined
     * animation frames), so this widget offers no jog wheel. Instead, the shuttle ring is capable of both fast and
     * very slow playback. Click and drag the shuttle ring pointer itself (shown above in green), or click in the
     * rest of the ring area to nudge the pointer to the next preset speed in that direction.
     *
     * The Animation widget also provides a "realtime" button (in the upper-left) that keeps animation time in sync
     * with the end user's system clock, typically displaying "today" or "right now." This mode is not available in
     * ClockRange.CLAMPED or ClockRange.LOOP_STOP mode if the current time is outside of Clock's startTime and endTime.
     * <pre>
     *     Example:
     *     {@code
     *     SimplePanel animationPanel = new SimplePanel();
     *     Clock clock = new Clock();
     *     ClockViewModel clockViewModel = new ClockViewModel(clock);
